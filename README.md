# Rigor and Reproducibility - Fall 2023

## Computational Reproducibility Homework

**Description:** Set up a free GitHub account and create your first repository. Go to Google Colab and create a simple analysis file. In that analysis file, print todayâ€™s date, a simple arithmetic operation (e.g. 2*5) and write a brief reflection (no more than 300 words) on how using repositories, tracking changes and publishing like GitHub can help with computational reproducibility. Post this file to your GitHub repository and submit the link to the repository with your homework in it.
